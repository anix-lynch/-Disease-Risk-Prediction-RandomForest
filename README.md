## ❤️ Predicting Cardiovascular Disease Risk with Random Forest

In this project, we’ll build a predictive model using the **random forest algorithm** to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We’ll explore the dataset visually using **seaborn** and **Matplotlib** and preprocess it using **Scikit-learn** to ensure it’s ready for training. Ready to dive into data analysis and machine learning for healthcare? Let’s go! 🚀🧑‍⚕️

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **cardiovascular disease risk** using a **random forest classifier**. We’ll work through a well-structured pipeline, beginning with data exploration to uncover insights about critical risk factors such as **age**, **gender**, **blood pressure**, **cholesterol levels**, and other relevant attributes. 

We’ll use **seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to visualize relationships between these features and the target variable (CVD risk). Following this, we’ll employ **Scikit-learn** to perform data preprocessing tasks like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical data. Finally, we’ll build and evaluate a **random forest classifier** to predict CVD risk.
